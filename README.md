# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-AND-CRITIQUE-SYSTEM
The Movie Criticism and Reconditioning System is designed to enable users to give reviews / ratings for the movie, and the recommendation system provides a platform for users to recommend movies. The recommendation system analyzes users' activities, film preferences and suggestions. The critical system evaluates the fate of films by analyzing reviews and observations about films. The user registers with a site review or comments about the movies they have seen. Most systems related to film data are limited to one or two functions. They usually only offer customers one or two features, such as recommending, reviewing expectations, etc. Film teasers cannot find a single venue where they can learn, and fantasize about their favorite films. Availability of a single platform where the user can make recommendations about their interests. Include interesting information such as budget, gross earnings, ratings, duration and style, get ratings and reviews for an image and make it. A good resource that can get recommendations and expectations on whether the film will be a hit / flop has inspired us to create a film critical system.

Movie Criticism System can give users reviews / ratings for the movie and visualize various aspects of the movie to get interesting information about them and whether the movie is a hit / flop. We also designed a recommendation system. Recommended System A system that wants to evaluate or filter preferences according to the user's choice. Recommended systems are used in a variety of fields, including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags and products in general. The recommendation system is to make a list of recommendations in two ways.
• Collaborative filtering: Collaborative filtering approaches build a model based on the consumer's past behavior (i.e. the items purchased or searched by the user) and similar decisions taken by other customers. This model is used to predict the item (or rating for the item) that consumers are interested in.
• Content-based filtering: Content-based filtering procedures use a range of discrete attributes of an item to recommend additional items with similar properties. Content-based filtering methods rely entirely on item description and user preferences profile. It recommends items based on the user's previous preferences.
